            <summary>
            This class uses a symmetric key algorithm (Rijndael/AES) to encrypt and
            decrypt data. As long as it is initialized with the same constructor
            parameters, the class will use the same key. Before performing encryption,
            the class can prepend random bytes to plain text and generate different
            encrypted values from the same plain text, encryption key, initialization
            vector, and other parameters. This class is thread-safe.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Be careful when performing encryption and decryption. There is a bug
            ("feature"?) in .NET Framework, which causes corruption of encryptor/
            decryptor if a cryptographic exception occurs during encryption/
            decryption operation. To correct the problem, re-initialize the class
            instance when a cryptographic exception occurs.
